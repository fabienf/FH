{"text": "Trump calls off Chicago rally following violent clashes Donald Trump has called off a rally in Chicago after protests against the Republican presidential front-runner led to violent clashes.  Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the venue at the University of Illinois hours before Mr Trump was due.  Inside the auditorium, fighting broke out between supporters and protesters, who waved flags and chanted.  A statement from Mr Trump's campaign said the candidate decided to postpone the event after meeting with police.  But a Chicago Police Department spokesman said the force was not consulted in the decision to postpone the rally.  At the rally there were chants for Mr Trump from his supporters and for Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders from some of the protesters. There were several violent clashes, some sparked by Trump supporters attempting to wrestle flags from protesters.  One protester had to be physically removed from the stage by what appeared to be a Secret Service agent.  Violent clashes continued outside the venue, with helicopter footage showing chaotic scenes as police attempted to control the large crowds. The full statement from Mr Trump's campaign read:  Mr. Trump just arrived in Chicago and after meeting with law enforcement has determined that for the safety of all of the tens of thousands of people that have gathered in and around the arena, tonight's rally will be postponed to another date.   Thank you very much for your attendance and please go in peace.   Speaking to Fox News after the events, Mr Trump denied using hate speech or playing any part in fostering division.   I represent a large group of people that have a lot of anger,  he said.  There is tremendous anger out there on both sides.   Discussing the decision to cancel the rally, he said:  I think it was a very good thing we did, I think it was an intelligent decision.  Will it harm Trump's prospects? Laura Bicker, BBC Washington Reporter It was supposed to be a political rally. Instead, many of the scenes resembled a bar-room brawl. Protesters had spent days planning the disruption, and they succeeded. The scenes inside the venue, where Trump supporters and protestors shoved and shouted at one another, were raw and angry.  The two sides have one thing in common: rage. Many Trump supporters are disillusioned and disenfranchised by a political establishment they feel does not represent them. The protesters in turn perceive the tone and rhetoric of Mr Trump's campaign as racist and divisive.  Will it harm the billionaire's election prospects? He may come across as the candidate who was denied the right to speak at his own political event. Or it may make voters wonder whether his entire campaign would be beset by rage. And if it comes down to a contest of angry Americans - are there more with him or against him?  Staff at the university had earlier petitioned administrators to cancel the rally, citing concerns it would create a  hostile and physically dangerous environment  for students.  Earlier on Friday, 32 people were arrested after protests at a rally held by Mr Trump rally in St Louis, Missouri.  Mr Trump was repeatedly interrupted by the protesters, who he called a  disgrace .  These latest clashes come just a day after a Trump supporter was charged with assault after multiple videos showed him punching a protester at a campaign rally in North Carolina.  The billionaire later said that the supporter's actions were  appropriate .","image_url": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/56B1/production/_88739122_1ebece79-9150-4252-8954-d5dcaefb826d.jpg","like": 2000 ,"love": 84,"haha": 55 ,"wow": 88,"sad": 15,"angry": 21},
{"text": "Ben Carson confirms backing for Donald Trump for US presidency   Former Republican hopeful Ben Carson has confirmed his support for his former rival and front-runner Donald Trump in the US presidential race.  He made the endorsement at a joint news conference in Florida with Mr Trump, ahead of primaries there on Tuesday.  The winner of the Republican nomination will face Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders for the Democrats, in November.  Mr Carson is the second former candidate to endorse Mr Trump after New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.  A retired neurosurgeon, Mr Carson was an early favourite but dropped out last week after failing to gain significant popular support.  The endorsement came a day after an elderly white man was charged with assault for allegedly punching a young protester during a rally for Mr Trump in North Carolina on Wednesday.  Video footage taken by bystanders shows John McGraw, 78, apparently hitting 26-year-old Rakeem Jones as he was being escorted away by police.  Analysis: Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Miami There are two sure-fire ways to draw Donald Trump's ire. The first is to directly criticise the New Yorker. The second is to pose a threat to his success.  Ben Carson never did the former but for a few weeks last autumn he challenged Mr Trump in Iowa polls and was rewarded with a full dose of the real estate mogul's derision.  Bygones, however, seem to be bygones. Now the retired neurosurgeon is endorsing the man who once compared him to a child molester.  A Trump-Carson alliance should not come as much of a surprise, however. Both candidates tapped into the desire among disenchanted conservative voters to find a candidate outside the traditional political world. Both offered sharp critiques of the Republican  establishment .  Mr Carson still has a loyal following, particularly among evangelical voters, and he could be a valuable asset to Mr Trump on the campaign trail as the New Yorker looks to secure the Republican nomination in the weeks ahead.  Republican debate: Civility breaks out  Obama: 'Don't blame me for Trump'  Who are the Muslims supporting Trump?  'Political stuff' Mr Carson said Mr Trump had a  cerebral  side.   I have found in talking with him, that there's a lot more alignment, philosophically and spiritually, than I ever thought that there was,  Mr Carson said of his former rival.   Donald Trump talks a lot about making America great. It's not just talk, he means it.   Asked about insults that the two candidates had thrown at each other in the early stages of the campaign, Mr Carson said they had  buried the hatchet .   That was political stuff,  he said.  That happens in American politics.   Meanwhile Mr Trump explained why he had targeted his competitor.   The one person who just kept sneaking up on me, I could not lose him, is Dr Ben Carson,  Mr Trump said.  I fought back, and I hit him hard, which is politics, and he understands that.   Mr Carson's endorsement follows a debate in Miami on Thursday night between Mr Trump and his remaining rivals Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich.  Mr Trump, a billionaire businessman from New York with no political experience, has dominated the state primary contests so far.  More contests next Tuesday in five states, including Florida and Ohio, could extend Mr Trump's lead and determine whether Mr Rubio and Mr Kasich can continue in the race.  On Friday Mr Rubio and his campaign admitted that Ohio Governor Mr Kasich had a better chance of winning in the state than he did.  Mr Rubio's communications director, Alex Conant, told CNN Mr Kasich was  the best bet  to defeat Mr Trump in Ohio, while only Mr Rubio could do so in Florida.
